# An IB Extend Essay written in LaTeX
### Why is it on Github?
Initially I just needed somewhere to serve my pdf file from, to show others the document, but I chose to publish the LaTeX code and related documents like the bib file so that others can use my document as a template in the future.

## About my essay
### What is my essay about?
My essay attempted to model fluid flow in a 2d environment around cylinders through the use of vector calculus principles.
It was written for the Math AA HL course rather than the Physics HL course for the reason that I chose to focus more on the derivation of concepts and the pure mathematics of it rather than the applications and results.

### Why LaTeX?
I chose LaTeX for the reason that, quite simply, it makes the math *look good*.
