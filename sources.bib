abstract = {A derivative of a function of several variables with respect to one independent variable is called a partial derivative. The other variables are treated as constants during the differentiation. There are some useful identities that allow manipulations of expressions containing partial derivatives. The differential of a function of several variables (an exact differential) has one term for each variable, consisting of a partial derivative times the differential of the independent variable. This differential form delivers the value of an infinitesimal change in the function produced by infinitesimal changes in the independent variables. Differential forms exist that are not the differentials of any function. Such a differential form is called an inexact differential. Relative maxima and minima of a function of several variables are found by solving simultaneously the equations obtained by setting all partial derivatives equal to zero. Constrained maxima and minima of a function of several variables can be found by the method of Lagrange multipliers. The gradient operator is a vector derivative operator that produces a vector when applied to a scalar function. The divergence operator is a vector derivative operator that produces a scalar when applied to a vector function. The curl operator is a vector derivative operator that produces a vector when applied to a vector function. The Laplacian operator is equivalent to the divergence of the gradient of a scalar function.}

abstract = {In this chapter, we consider the basic calculus of functions of two or more independent variables, that is, the calculus of multivariate functions, or multivariate calculus. This book has so far focussed on functions of a single independent variable, for example, y(x) or f(z); however, most realistic models of physical and financial systems involve more than one independent variable. In addition, as we saw in the previous chapter with the discussion of exact ODEs, it is often very convenient with work with mathematical tools that require some knowledge of multivariate calculus. We will see an additional example of such tools later in this chapter.}

abstract = {Acid gases (H2S and CO2) must be removed from the crude natural gas. The process performance may be deteriorated because of ship movement on FPSO (Floating production, storage and offloading). This research aims to investigate the effects of ship movement (or ship motion) on acid gas removal performance in the amine absorber with Mellapak 250.X structured packing. A simple cylindrical column (packed zone: 0.1m diameter Ã— 0.245m high) was used as the domain for the calculations. A porous media CFD (computational fluid dynamics) model was developed in the framework of Eulerian two-fluid flows with user-defined functions (UDF) taking into account liquid dispersion in the packed zone. The effective interfacial area and mal-distribution factor were compared for two cases of vertical standing and ship motion.}
